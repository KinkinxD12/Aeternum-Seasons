## 🌱 About this project / Sobre este proyecto

**This plugin was born from a simple idea – and a lot of heart.**  
Recently, I lost my job, and thanks to that unexpected turn, I was able to dedicate myself full-time to building this during the holidays. It’s been a labor of love, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I’ve enjoyed creating it. If you’d like to support me while I look for work, that would mean the world. I’ll keep updating and improving Aeternum Seasons over time!

**Este plugin nació de una idea sencilla… y mucho corazón.**  
Recientemente me quedé sin trabajo, y gracias a eso pude dedicarme de lleno a desarrollarlo durante las fechas navideñas. Ha sido un trabajo hecho con cariño, y espero que lo disfruten tanto como yo disfruté crearlo. Si quieren apoyarme mientras encuentro trabajo, ¡sería increíble! Seguiré actualizando y mejorando Aeternum Seasons con el tiempo.

## 🍂 What is Aeternum Seasons?

Aeternum Seasons brings a cozy, Stardew-Valley-style year cycle to vanilla Minecraft – **without killing your TPS**.

Watch your world slowly change through **Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter**:
- Biome colors shift smoothly
- Snow covers the ground in winter
- Autumn forests turn golden
- Sky and weather follow the season  
All fully optimized and spread over time to avoid lag spikes.

## 🔥❄️ Two Optional Adventure Realms

- **Frost Realm** – Glowstone portal. Blizzards, low visibility, frozen terrain, and icy mob variants that slow and freeze you.  
- **Heat / Infernal Realm** – Nether Wart Block portal. Scorching heat, dangerous terrain, and fiery mobs that burn and hit harder.

Each realm has its own risks, atmosphere, and progression – turning your survival world into a mini adventure RPG, while still feeling vanilla-friendly.

When the day comes that I can no longer maintain the plugin and it’s complete enough, I will open-source the code.
Right now I’m going through a difficult situation because I was laid off from my job, and I’m hoping that during these holidays a small miracle can become reality and that you might support me by supporting the plugin.
More than anything, I want the plugin to grow. I’m not asking for anything extra – I just want to keep improving it and deliver a high-quality plugin.
